# Notification Dropdown Layout Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Overlapping Content Problems:
1. **Text overlapping** - Long notification messages were overlapping with other elements
2. **Layout spacing issues** - Inconsistent padding and margins causing visual clutter
3. **Content overflow** - Text content wasn't properly contained within notification items
4. **Poor text wrapping** - Long text was not breaking properly

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Improved Text Layout**
- Added `break-words` class for proper text wrapping
- Used `leading-relaxed` for better line spacing
- Added `overflow-hidden` to prevent content overflow
- Used `truncate` for time stamps to prevent overflow

### 2. **Better Spacing & Padding**
- Increased dropdown width from `w-96` to `w-[420px]` (384px → 420px)
- Unified padding: `px-5 py-4` for all sections (header, items, footer)
- Added proper margins between elements (`mb-1`, `mb-2`)
- Used `flex-shrink-0` to prevent icon shrinking

### 3. **Enhanced Visual Hierarchy**
- Changed title from `<p>` to `<h4>` with proper spacing
- Added `pr-2` to title for spacing from unread indicator
- Better positioning of unread indicator with `mt-1`
- Improved icon alignment with `mt-1`

### 4. **Consistent Container Structure**
- Used `min-h-0` and `min-w-0` to prevent flex item overflow
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent important elements from shrinking
- Better flex container management with proper spacing

## 📱 Layout Structure

```

├── Header (px-5 py-4)
│   ├── "Notifications" title
│   └── "Mark all read" button

│   └── Each Notification (px-5 py-4)
│       ├── Icon (flex-shrink-0, mt-1)

│           ├── Title & Unread Indicator (flex, items-start)
│           ├── Message (break-words, leading-relaxed)
│           └── Timestamp (flex, truncate)
└── Footer (px-5 py-3)
    └── "View all notifications" button
```
